### Purpose of Use
The team at Bitcoin Butler noticed that advanced analytics is becoming enormously popular in the fintech industry. It offers developers and companies a way to analyze thousands of large datasets and to use computer predictions that drive investments and decision making. These large datasets typically contain data that involves a time series. A time series consists of a particular set of discrete and consecutive time values that occurred during a period of time.

Identify unusual patterns in time series data by using Pandas and other tools.

Search for patterns in seasonality by using the hvPlot visualization tool.

Then RAMP it up to Tensorflow /
